# GuidGent

GuidGent is an agentic app that becomes your study buddy, suggesting proper study materials based on your preferences. It leverages Langgraph and LlamaIndex behind the scenes to build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system on top of the CBSE maths syllabus. For the backend, please check out [guidgent-service](https://github.com/ITZSHOAIB/guidgent-service).

This UI for the GuidGent app is built using SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI.
